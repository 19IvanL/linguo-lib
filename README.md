# linguo-library

Linguo library for Linguo's datamodels and database access.


## About this library

This library is built with Apache Maven and used by the following applications:

* [linguo-app](https://github.com/19IvanL/linguo-app)
* [linguo-desktop](https://github.com/19IvanL/linguo-app)


## Technical requeriments

To be able to run the app, your system will need the following requeriments:

* **Java 8** to compile the whole program. Other versions of Java could work, but they haven't been tested yet.


## How to run it

This project is structured as an Eclipse Maven project, and ideally, it should be run as such.

If the compilation doesn't throw any error during or after its process (and it shouldn't if you followed the steps carefully), you are ready to go.
